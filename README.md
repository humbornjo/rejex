# rejex
sometimes I was told to extract some data from a json style log, and I spend quite some time on learning bash regex. Which I keep forgeting every time.

So I decide to start this project to save my future ass.

# road map

SPA = wasm(rust) + react

- dev web ui and mock a wasm interface
- dev wasm and sub the mocked interface
- dev the additional features using ts

# milestone

- parse a json scheme and get a treesitter like obj
- provide (multi) range/single selection
- allow customize regex and preview
- other features like add support for loop, sort and duplicate removing
